# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
 
# Good Data Visualization Example:
### **Visualization**: Van Gogh in 37 Self-Portraits

### **Why is it good?**

This visualization effectively communicates the evolution of Vincent van Gogh's artistic style over time. It combines a visually appealing design with clarity and ease of understanding:

- **Clear Narrative**: The visualization presents the data in a logical chronological order, which makes it easy to follow the progression of van Goghâ€™s work.
- **Effective Use of Color and Layout**: Colors and layout elements are carefully chosen to group related elements without overwhelming the viewer. The use of consistent formatting ensures a harmonious design.
- **Interactive Elements**: Interactive features allow users to explore each self-portrait and dive deeper into specific time periods, enhancing engagement and understanding.

### **How Could This Visualization Be Improved?**

- **Tooltips or Annotations**: Adding explanations or insights for key transitions in van Goghâ€™s style would provide additional depth and context for the audience.
- **Accessibility Features**: Implementing features like alternative text descriptions and high-contrast color schemes would improve accessibility for a broader audience.



# Bad Data Visualization Example:
### **Visualization**: Heat Map Example from Data Viz Project

### **Why is it bad?**

This heat map fails to effectively present its data for several reasons:

- **Visual Clutter**: The chart is overly dense, with little spacing between data points, making it hard to discern patterns or trends.
- **Poor Color Choices**: The color palette lacks contrast and uses too many shades, creating confusion instead of clarity. It also makes it inaccessible for colorblind users.
- **Lack of Labels and Legends**: Key elements like axis labels and a legend are missing, leaving the viewer without a clear understanding of what the data represents.
- **Misleading Representation**: The use of a heat map for this data type may not be appropriate, as it exaggerates small variations in the data.

### **How Could This Visualization Be Improved?**

- **Use a Simpler Chart Type**: A bar chart or scatter plot could better represent the data, reducing visual clutter and increasing interpretability.
- **Add Descriptive Labels and Legends**: Clearly labeled axes, a legend explaining the color coding, and concise titles would make the visualization easier to understand.
- **Simplify the Color Scheme**: A limited and high-contrast color palette would improve readability and accessibility.
- **Reorganize the Layout**: Increasing spacing between elements and avoiding overloading the viewer with too much information at once would make the visualization more digestible.



      
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
