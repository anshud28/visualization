# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
  ### **Good Data Visualization Example**  
#### **Visualization:** Van Gogh in 37 Self-Portraits  
#### **Accessibility:**  
This visualization is visually appealing and easy to understand, but it has some accessibility issues:  

- The color scheme isnâ€™t colorblind-friendly, which could make it hard for some users to differentiate elements.  
- Thereâ€™s no alternative text or descriptions for screen readers, making it less accessible to visually impaired audiences.  
- The text size and spacing might not meet accessibility standards for everyone.  

#### **Reproducibility:**  
The visualization seems to have been created programmatically, but itâ€™s not fully reproducible:  

- Thereâ€™s no information about the data source or the tools used to create it.  
- Without sharing the process or code, itâ€™s hard for someone else to replicate the work.  

#### **Equity:**  
This visualization assumes the viewer is familiar with Van Gogh, which might exclude people who donâ€™t have that context.  

- It doesnâ€™t provide enough background for viewers who arenâ€™t already familiar with the artistâ€™s work.  
- The design choices focus more on aesthetics than making the visualization accessible to a wider audience.  

#### **How Could This Visualization Be Improved?**  

1. **Accessibility Improvements:**  
   - Use a colorblind-friendly palette, like Viridis, and consider adding patterns to help distinguish elements.  
   - Add alternative text for screen readers and increase text size for better readability.  

2. **Reproducibility Enhancements:**  
   - Share the data and code used to create the visualization.  
   - Provide step-by-step instructions on how the visualization was made.  

3. **Equity Adjustments:**  
   - Include some background information about Van Goghâ€™s self-portraits for viewers who might not know the context.  
   - Add comparisons or references that could help audiences from different cultural or educational backgrounds connect with the content.  



### **Bad Data Visualization Example**  
#### **Visualization:** Heat Map Example from Data Viz Project  
#### **Accessibility:**  
This heat map is poorly designed and hard to understand:  

- The color gradient is confusing and inaccessible for colorblind users.  
- It doesnâ€™t have axis labels or legends, so itâ€™s hard to figure out what the data actually represents.  
- Thereâ€™s no explanation or alternative format for people who might struggle with the visual representation.  

#### **Reproducibility:**  
This visualization is not reproducible:  

- The data source and methods arenâ€™t shared, so itâ€™s impossible to verify or recreate.  
- It seems like it wasnâ€™t created programmatically, which makes it harder to reproduce or improve.  

#### **Equity:**  
The heat map design makes it difficult for non-experts to interpret:  

- Itâ€™s overly complicated, which could exclude people without technical knowledge.  
- The design exaggerates small differences in the data, which might mislead viewers.  

#### **How Could This Visualization Be Improved?**  

1. **Accessibility Improvements:**  
   - Replace the color scheme with one thatâ€™s easier to interpret, like a high-contrast palette.  
   - Add labels, legends, and annotations to explain what the data means.  
   - Offer descriptive text or an alternative way to present the data for better inclusivity.  

2. **Reproducibility Enhancements:**  
   - Share the data and the steps used to create the visualization.  
   - Use tools like Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib or Seaborn to make the process reproducible.  

3. **Equity Adjustments:**  
   - Simplify the design to make it easier for more people to understand.  
   - Avoid exaggerating small data differences to ensure a fair and accurate representation.  


- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
